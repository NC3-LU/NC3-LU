The NC3 represents Luxembourg as a national cybersecurity coordination center
(National Coordination Center - NCC) within the European network under the
aegis of the
[European Cybersecurity Competence Center](https://cybersecurity-centre.europa.eu/index_en)
(in Bucharest).

The ECCC aims to increase Europeâ€™s cybersecurity capacities and competitiveness,
working together with a Network of National Coordination Centres (NCCs) to build a
strong cybersecurity Community.

The Luxembourg House of Cybersecurity (LHC) has been designated as the NCC for
Luxembourg. Our vision is based on opensource and we aim to become a major actor of the
cybersecurity community. This website aims to present our software contributions in this
regard.
