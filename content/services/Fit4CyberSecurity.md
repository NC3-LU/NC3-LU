**Fit4Cybersecurity** is a service that includes multiple self-assessment tools.
Its main goal is to allow users to quickly assess their information security maturity
in different areas that CASES considers critical. Using all these self-assessment tool
is _anonymous_ and _for free_.



## Why?

[Fit4Cybersecurity](https://fit4cybersecurity.cases.lu) is a quick online self-assessment
tool helping business owners evaluate their security maturity and enhance their cyber risk protection.
This is the first step of a more thorough assessment, that we call a _Diagnostic CASES_.
The latter dives deeper into the organisation's context, its state of practice and the
existing documentation in terms of cybersecurity risk management, with the goal to
address gaps with respect to baseline practices.
<!-- A [CASES Diagnostic]({% link _services/diagnostic.markdown %}) could be performed for free by one of our Cybersecurity experts, on the condition that the score obtained in the Fit4Cybersecurity self-evaluation is at least of 65/100 and the organisation is located in Luxembourg. -->

Complementing Fit4Cybersecurity, [Fit4Contract](https://contract.cases.lu) is a similar
tool whose aim is to help business owners ensure that contracts (already signed but
especially those about to be signed with third parties) for the procurement of ICT
services cover the essential information security aspects. The _raison d'Ãªtre_ of
[Fit4Contract](https://contract.cases.lu) is that a lot of small non-ICT organisations
are often insufficiently prepared to negotiate contract clauses with ICT service
providers.

And finally, [Fit4Privacy](https://fit4privacy.cases.lu) is a third tool in the
self-assessment bundle, created in cosultation with the
[CNPD](https://cnpd.public.lu/en.html), with the purpose to give business owners a good
initial overview of their maturity in privacy and data protection, as required by the GDPR since May 2018.
