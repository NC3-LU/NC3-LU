 The purpose of Observatory is to provide elements of information with as
 much neutrality and reliability as possible, while being focused on
 cybersecurity threats from an organisation's perspective.
 Called the "Threat Observatory Platform" (T.O.P.), it aims to support
 its users with evidence-based information on emerging threats, in order
 to facilitate their decision-making processes regarding the prevention
 strategies to be undertaken. C3 TOP collects evidence on cyber risks and
 trends, and uses various models and benchmarking to provide organisations
 with insights into how they may be exposed to existing or emerging types
 of threats.
