MOSP is a platform to create, edit and share valid JSON objects.

MOSP supports any kind of JSON objects, you just have to specify a JSON schema.
The instance objects.monarc.lu is operated by NC3-LU.
It is dedicated to gather security related objects, in the first place aimed to be used with MONARC.

Objects officially provided by the MONARC project are available on the NC3-LU instance.
Note that any object created with a JSON schema provided by the MONARC project
will be compatible with the MONARC software.
In other words, you can use our JSON schemas in order to create objects
(standards, mapping, etc.) for a usage in your own security analysis.
