__cybersecurity Certification based On Risk evALuation and treatment__,
is a European Union-funded project under CEF Telecom Call, that aims to
elaborate a toolkit and methodology to speed up the certification process in
line with the EU Cybersecurity Act or CSA (Regulation EU 2019/881).

The project aims to address challenges concerning self-certification and the
basic level of assurance, as well as to enhance the exchange of good practices,
collaboration and information sharing related to performing evaluations in line
with the CSA.
