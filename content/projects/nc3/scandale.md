Provide a real-time monitoring of the security assurance level of an IT infrastructure.

scandale-project (scanDALE) is meant to monitor constituencies' actions after
being notified about security issues.
The idea is to timestamp scan results with a Time Stamp Authority to have a
clear and indisputable incident timeline following a notification.
The aim is to nudge constituencies to take action and also give them leverage
on non-cooperating suppliers.

No infrastructure change or patch after repeated notifications is not a good
trajectory to be on--hence the name, scandale.

The [CIRCL team](https://www.circl.lu) and the NC3-LU OSS team are working
together in order to improve this shameful situation.
