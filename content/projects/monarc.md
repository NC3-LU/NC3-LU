The processing of sensitive information and personal data is crucial,
not only for the degree of trust that your customers place in your
services, but also for the sustainability of your business.

MONARC is an iterative and qualitative method of risk analysis in four stages,
broadly inspired by ISO/IEC 27005.

MONARC was created by the [CASES team](https://www.cases.lu) which is now part of NC3-LU.
